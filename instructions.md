# 1. Product Overview

## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this scraper is to **collect accurate, up-to-date hotel information** from multiple travel sites (e.g., Booking.com, Expedia, TripAdvisor, etc.) for use in comparative analytics, pricing intelligence, inventory management, or third-party data integrations.

## 1.2 Scope
- **Data Coverage**: The scraper targets publicly available pages containing hotel data.  
- **Geographical Range**: Global coverage (all countries), subject to each site’s Terms of Service (ToS) and applicable local regulations.  
- **Platforms**: Desktop and/or mobile web pages of major travel aggregators and direct hotel booking sites.  

## 1.3 Goals and Objectives
1. **Consolidate Hotel Data**: Provide a single, normalized dataset of hotels, including location, room availability, pricing, reviews, and amenities.  
2. **Real-Time or Near Real-Time**: Enable frequent updates (e.g., daily or hourly) to capture current pricing and availability.  
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Handle large volumes of concurrent requests (thousands to millions of hotel listings).

# 2. Functional Requirements

## 2.1 Core Data Fields
1. **Hotel Identification**  
   - Hotel name  
   - Hotel ID (site-specific identifier)  
   - Address / Geographical coordinates (optional if shown)  
   - Region or city name  
   - Number of tennis courts
   - Number and type of tennis courts surfaces
   - Other sports facilities and surfaces

2. **Room Information**  
   - Room types (e.g., single, double, suite)  
   - Pricing per night (base currency + additional taxes/fees, if available)  
   - Availability (dates, sold-out indicators)  
   - Cancellation policies (if listed)

3. **Ratings & Reviews**  
   - Star rating (if provided)  
   - Aggregated review score (out of 5, 10, or 100, depending on the site)  
   - Number of reviews  

4. **Amenities**  
   - Key features: free Wi-Fi, breakfast included, pool, spa, gym, parking, etc.  
   - Any mention of unique amenities (pet-friendly, kid-friendly, etc.)

5. **Media (Optional)**  
   - Image URLs (often large sets; must handle carefully to avoid excessive bandwidth usage)

6. **Metadata**  
   - Source website name  
   - Scrape timestamp  
   - URL references to each listing page  

## 2.2 Additional (Optional) Features
- **Booking URL**: Direct link for booking or “see availability.”  
- **Promotions**: If the site displays discount codes or limited-time deals.  
- **User-Added Data**: Aggregation of user questions/answers or forums (TripAdvisor, for instance). (Only if needed and legally permissible.)

## 2.3 Frequency & Scheduling
1. **Incremental/Real-Time**: Possibly triggered daily or multiple times a day to update inventory and prices.  
2. **Full Index Refresh**: Periodic re-scrape of the entire list of hotels (e.g., once a week or month) to ensure no stale entries.  
3. **Trigger-based** (Future / [Speculative]): Trigger a partial scrape only when prices change (requires subscription or direct API when available).

# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Performance and Scalability
- **Concurrent Requests**: The system should handle tens of thousands of page requests per hour without timeouts.  
- **Response Time**: Each page parse operation should complete within a few seconds, subject to external site latency.  
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Support deployment on containerized platforms (Docker/Kubernetes) or serverless solutions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for auto-scaling.

## 3.2 Reliability & Resilience
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retries on transient network errors (HTTP 5xx, timeouts) with exponential backoff.  
- **Robust Logging**: Detailed logs for each HTTP request, response status, parse success/failure.  
- **Failure Recovery**: If partial scraping fails, the system should gracefully resume from the last successfully processed listing or page.

## 3.3 Data Compliance & Ethical Considerations
- **Terms of Service**: Respect each site’s robots.txt policies, rate limits, or designated APIs where possible.  
- **Privacy Laws**: Avoid collecting personally identifiable information (PII) from user-generated content.  
- **User Consent**: If scraping user reviews or personal data, ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA).  

## 3.4 Maintainability
- **Configurable Selectors**: Separate site-specific DOM paths, CSS selectors, or XPath expressions into external config files for quick adaptation if the layout changes.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Code structure that easily accommodates new website “plugins” without rewriting core logic.  
- **Automated Tests**: Include unit and integration tests to confirm correct data extraction even after site layout changes.

# 4. Technical Architecture

## 4.1 System Diagram (High-Level)
1. **Scraper Agents**  
   - Written primarily in Python using frameworks like **Scrapy** or **Playwright**.  
   - For dynamic pages (AJAX-heavy or React-based), use **Selenium** or **Playwright** headless browsers.
2. **Scheduler**  
   - Cron jobs or a Celery-based task queue to trigger scraping tasks (daily, hourly, or on demand).  
3. **Proxy/Rotation Service**  
   - Use a rotating proxy solution to avoid IP bans (e.g., BrightData, Smartproxy) and set custom user-agents.  
4. **Data Pipeline**  
   - Clean and standardize data (hotel name, address, rating, etc.).  
   - Transform to a structured format (JSON, CSV, or direct DB inserts).  
5. **Storage**  
   - A relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) for large volume.  
   - Optionally, a data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) for advanced analytics.  

## 4.2 Parsing & Normalization
1. **HTML Parsing**:  
   - **BeautifulSoup** or **lxml** for stable parsing of page content.  
   - Alternatively, use **Playwright** for pages requiring JavaScript rendering.  
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Standardize price data (convert currencies if needed).  
   - Normalize rating scales (e.g., convert 8.2/10 to 4.1/5).  
   - Resolve inconsistent field naming across different sites.  

## 4.3 Rate Limiting & Anti-Detection
1. **Politeness**: Pause 1–5 seconds (configurable) between requests to a single domain to avoid overloading.  
2. **CAPTCHA Handling**: If certain sites frequently show CAPTCHAs, integrate a solver only if permissible or revert to official APIs.  
3. **Fingerprint Randomization**: Randomize user-agent strings, possibly add headless detection bypass for advanced front-end frameworks.

# 5. Data Flow Example

1. **Scheduler** triggers the scraper: “Scrape hotels from Site A for city X.”  
2. **Scraper** requests page listings (with proxy rotation) → obtains listing URLs.  
3. For each listing URL, the **Scraper** fetches detail pages → extracts metadata (title, star rating, address, price, etc.).  
4. **Parser** normalizes the data → outputs a structured row or JSON record.  
5. **Pipeline** loads data into DB or data lake.  
6. If a full job completes successfully, store logs → publish a notification that updated data is ready.

# 6. Testing & Validation

## 6.1 Unit Tests
- **HTML Parsing**: Mock raw HTML from each target site to confirm correct extraction of data fields.  
- **Currency Conversion** (if needed): Test with multiple numeric formats (e.g., `$100`, `EUR 99`, `100.00 GBP`).  
- **Edge Cases**: Missing rating, hidden price fields, or new site layout changes.

## 6.2 Integration Tests
- **End-to-End**: Trigger a small-scale scrape job on a staging environment. Validate data correctness in the final database.  
- **Network Reliability**: Simulate random timeouts or slow responses to ensure robust retry logic.  

## 6.3 Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Confirm the system can handle parallel requests with minimal errors.  
- **Stress Testing**: Scale up concurrency to identify system bottlenecks (database write speed, proxy limitations, etc.).

# 7. Security & Data Privacy

1. **Compliance**: Ensure none of the data is behind paywalls or login gates that forbid automation.  
2. **Data Encryption**: At-rest encryption (e.g., AES-256) for any stored data containing sensitive details (though typically hotel data is public).  
3. **Access Controls**: Restrict who can run or see scraped data. If integrated with third parties, ensure secure keys/tokens.  

---

# 8. Risks & Mitigation

1. **Layout Changes**: Sites regularly update HTML structure.  
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain flexible selectors and a monitoring job that alerts on parse failures.  

2. **IP Bans & Anti-Scraping**  
   - **Mitigation**: Proxy rotation, user-agent rotation, respect site TOS. Possibly rely on official partnership APIs where feasible.

3. **Legal/ToS Violations**  
   - **Mitigation**: Thoroughly read each website’s Terms of Service, follow robots.txt, consider official data licensing or partnerships.  

4. **Data Inconsistencies**  
   - **Mitigation**: Data normalization with fallback rules. For example, if star rating not found, set to null or use default mapping.  

5. **Scalability Limitations**  
   - **Mitigation**: Container-based or serverless architecture for horizontal scaling. Break large tasks into smaller jobs.
